# 1RCBH-isotropization

README

In this folder you can find all the Mathematica notebooks needed to reproduce my work about the 1RCBH isotropization.

The notebook "1RCBH isotropization.nb" derives the Einstein's equations of motion (using the RGTC package), performs the asymptotic expansion in the UV, and performs the numerical evolution of the isotropization using the pseudospectral method. The other notebook, "1RCBH one-point function", derives the one-point functions (<T_\mu\nu>, <O_\phi>, <J_\mu>) using standard holographic renormalization with the help of the xAct package.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

If you somehow find the notebooks in this folder useful in your research, I kindly ask you to cite my original work.
